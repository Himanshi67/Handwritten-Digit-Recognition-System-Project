# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates the power of neural networks in image recognition tasks, particularly using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes a CNN with convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers to process and classify grayscale images of handwritten digits.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and reshaping of the MNIST dataset for optimal neural network performance.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Allows users to input an image index from the test set and displays the corresponding handwritten digit and the model's prediction.

## How to Run
1. **Install Requirements**: Ensure that TensorFlow and Matplotlib are installed in your Python environment.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Download the scripts to your local machine.
3. **Execute the Code**: Run the script in your Python environment to train the model, evaluate its accuracy, and use it to make predictions.

## Model Performance
The CNN achieves an accuracy rate, which is indicative of its reliability in classifying complex patterns like handwritten digits.
